Implement functions to compute Euclidean distance and Cosine Similarity between two input vectors a and b. 
These functions should return a scalar float value. To ensure that your functions are implemented correctly,
you may want to construct test cases and compare against results packages like numpy or sklearn.

Distance metrics can be found in distances.py and are being called while implementing KMeans and KNN.
Metrics computed:
1. Euclidean distance 
2. Cosine Similarity

(Comparisons against numpy implementation in main.py can be uncommented to test.)
